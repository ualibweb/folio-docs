The Export manager app allows users to view manual or automated file exports for specific export operations. The Export manager app supports the following types of exports: Authority control, Bursar, Circulation log, eHoldings, Bulk edit, and EDIFACT orders. While these exports are initiated from other apps and areas of FOLIO, the Export manager app allows administrative staff to check on the status of scheduled exports, view error details, and download files for review.

## Permissions

The permissions listed below allow you to interact with the Export manager app and determine what you can and cannot do within the app. If none of these permissions are assigned to a user, they are unable to see the Export manager app or any related information.

Note: For information on assigning permissions to users, see [Assigning permissions to a user record]({{< ref "/users.md#assigning-permissions-to-a-user-record" >}}).

The following are all the Export manager app permissions:

*  **Export manager: All.** This permission enables the Export manager app for the user and allows the user to view and access logs, download files from the Export manager app, and download and re-send EDIFACT export jobs. 
*  **Export manager: Download and re-send files.** This permission allows the user to download and re-send EDIFACT export jobs.

Since exports begin in other FOLIO apps, not in the Export Manager app, a user needs additional permissions to begin an export, but may download files given the **Export manager: All** permission.

*   Bulk edit
*   Bursar
*   Circulation log

Once an export is initiated in any of these areas, a log of the export appears in the Export manager app. The app’s **Search & filter** pane displays two tabs: **All** and **Organizations**. The **Organizations** tab supports EDIFACT order export, while all other supported exports are accessible using the **All** tab.

## Managing EDIFACT orders export jobs

A FOLIO tenant may be configured to support the export of EDIFACT orders to a vendor. This requires [configuration of **Integration details** on the Organization record]({{< ref "/organizations.md#adding-integration-details-to-a-vendor-organization" >}}). All exports are recorded and accessible in the **Export manager** app under the **Organizations** pane . The file is available for download in FOLIO, with no expiry date. If a library needs a new copy of the EDIFACT file that was created, they must use the download or resend options within the **Export manager** app. The **Resend** action will send a new copy of the previously exported EDIFACT file to the organization’s FTP site, where the library and the vendor can once again access the file.
